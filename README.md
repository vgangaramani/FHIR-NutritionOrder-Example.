# FHIR NutritionOrder Example

This repository shows how to combine core EHR data and a nutritionistâ€™s questionnaire using FHIR.

**Files included:**

- `Patient_Bundle.json`  
  Contains the Patient resource, Conditions (Hypertension and Type 2 Diabetes), and a Goal (Lose 20 pounds by June).

- `NutritionOrder.json`  
  Contains the prescribed nutrition plan: low sodium, high fiber, vegetarian preference, and additional instructions.

This example demonstrates how to link medical record data and unique nutrition details in a reusable FHIR format. Feel free to adapt or test in any FHIR sandbox.
